# Model View Router

MVR is a spin on traditional MVP (Model-View-Presenter).

As presented here, MVR is a communication pattern. As such, it does not require an external framework or library - only a perspective change. Embracing MVR entails writing your code differently, not adhering to an API.

MVR requires no external dependencies.
