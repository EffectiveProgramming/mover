Model View Router (MoVeR) is a spin on [Model View Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) and [Presenter First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenter_First). My hope is to put a concrete face on this potentially confusing pattern; specifically, as it relates to iOS.

As presented here, MoVeR is a communication **pattern**. As such, it does not require an external framework or library - only a perspective change. Embracing MoVeR entails writing your code differently, not adhering to an API.

One some level, I hope my current and future teams are able to embrace and evolve both the motivation and guidelines suggested herein. On a higher level, I hope you are encouraged to do the same.

I would appreciate feedback so don't hesitate to post questions or suggestions to the [Issues](https://github.com/EffectiveProgramming/mover/issues) associated with this repository. Keep in mind that this is currently a _work in progress_.

Cheers!
